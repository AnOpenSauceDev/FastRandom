> [!IMPORTANT]
> Faster Random requires a JVM that supports `RandomGenerator` and its LXM generators. <br>
> Some JRE's don't support this, and almost every "headless" variant of a JDK doesn't include these generators. <br> <br>
> Because of this, **please** warn people about your modpack containing Faster Random, as people crashing due to having a bad JDK/JRE is a pretty common (and people seem to think it's a Faster Random issue).
